# Athlete Performance and ACL Injury Analysis

# üèãÔ∏è Introduction
**ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament)** injuries are a significant concern in sports, impacting athlete performance, career longevity, and overall health. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset capturing athlete demographics, training regimens, match schedules, injury outcomes, and performance metrics. By exploring this data, we seek to uncover critical factors influencing ACL injury risk and athlete performance, while identifying meaningful relationships between training, recovery, and performance.

# ‚ÅâÔ∏è Key Questions
The project explores key factors influencing athlete performance and ACL injury risk. Analyzing how demographic factors like gender and playing position are linked to higher injury rates and examine how training metrics‚Äîsuch as intensity, hours, and recovery‚Äîaffect performance outcomes like fatigue and overall scores. Additionally, we study how fatigue, performance, and resting interact with ACL risk. 

# üë£ Next Steps
The next steps for this project involve building a predictive model to estimate ACL injury risk, enabling the identification of athletes at higher risk and supporting preventative measures. Additionally, further exploration of potential factors contributing to ACL risk will be conducted.
